There are seven Java classes with some unit tests.
You are welcome to submit new tests and improve the classes.

You need to have
[JDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit) 
and [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed.

To build everything and then test, just run:

```bash
$ make
```

Should work.
